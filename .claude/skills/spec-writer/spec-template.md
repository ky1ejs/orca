## Sub-agent Parallelization Plan

> **Note:** Only include this section if the implementation has meaningful parallelization opportunities (multiple independent tasks, cross-service work, or 3+ steps with no dependencies between some). Omit for sequential or simple implementations.

Tasks grouped for concurrent execution by Claude Code sub-agents.

### Parallel Group 1: [Name]
**Can start immediately - no dependencies**

Tasks: [List task numbers]
Agents needed: [Number]
Description: [What these tasks accomplish together]

### Parallel Group 2: [Name]
**Requires: Group 1 complete**

Tasks: [List task numbers]
Agents needed: [Number]

### Execution Diagram

```
Group 1: [Task A] [Task B]  (parallel)
              |
              v
Group 2: [Task C] [Task D]  (parallel)
              |
              v
Sequential:  [Task E]
```
